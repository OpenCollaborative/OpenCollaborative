# OpenCollaborative

OpenCollaborative is a business management tool with a view to assisting cooperatively organised businesses manage their affairs.

The system intends to facilitate:

* Different models of workplace democracy necessitated by either collective worker or consumer ownership that can be used interchangeably based on organisation size and structure
* Storage of policy such that it can be easily observed, maintained and challenged
* Easy access for members to observe imperative business information, including financial performance and projections; including automatic retrieval of this information from third party services on a real term basis
* Tight integration with task management services to help visualise internal business performance and allow for informed decision-making
* Member - and where applicable member position - storage.
